At ﬁrst only the elite and military could take part in the Olympic Games. But later they were open to all Greeks. Competitions in running, jumping, boxing and horse racing were held in cities and the winners competed in the Olympic Games every 4 years. Winners were honored by placing olive wreaths on their heads and singing songs about their strength. Originally these sport competitions were the games of friendship and any wars were stopped to allow the games to take place.

Leslie Kenton’s father, Stan, had started his jazz band the same month that she had been born in 1941 and over three years he became very famous. She spent a lot of time outdoors as she was sure there was a great mystery going on. Her dog (collie), whom she loved very much, was called Tuﬃe. Mother would let her go exploring in the caves nearby with her dog. But one day, when she was 5, she was picked up by the police and taken home in the car. Her mother disagreed with the police. She knew nobody would do any harm to her daughter. Her childhood was wild - she went on the road with her father’s band throughout America, Europe and South America and didn’t go to school until she was eleven. Sadly her parents divorced when she was ten. She remembers the day her mother told her they were separating, and they were going to live up in North California. The girl burst into tears.

In August 1999, Susan Beumee found a 200-year-old house on the internet and bought it at an auction before her husband, Hans, had ever seen it. It was a ruin. After three years of hard work and 200.000 pounds, it became a mansion valued at about 1 mln. pounds with an award from the Federation of Master Builders for restoration. The Beumees don’t want to say how much the house had cost them. It must have cost 300.000 to 350.000 pounds. ”It had belonged to an old lady who died,” Susan says, ”and it was in a completely terrible state”. Her secret, she says, was sympathetically, combining the listed building and its restored original features with a new extension. It was a lot of hard work, reseach and careful planning.

He then made a wooden box, painted it black inside and he placed a sheet of gelatin on which he put some of the salt. Then he placed something in front of the lens, then uncovered the lens for a second, covered it again and found that the waves of the light had recorded a permanent image on the gelatin. And so photography was born, and from it, later on, ﬁlms and television were developed.
